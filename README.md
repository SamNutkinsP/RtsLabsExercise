# RtsLabsExercise

This repository contains the at home coding exercises for RTS Labs. It is written as a C# / .NET 6 class library (`RtsLabsExercise`) with an associated XUnit test project (`RtsLabsExercise.Tests`). 

The two main methods for the exercise can be found in the [Algorithms](RtsLabsExercise/Algorithms.cs) class.
